# Breaking Down The URL Validation Regex!

In this tutorial, I will be breaking down the Regex (Regular Expression) that is used to validate URLs. A Regex is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern that can be used to validate user input.

## Summary

The following Regex is used to validate a URL!

/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/

### Anchors
Anchors are used to encapsulate the string in question.
- The ^ Symbol signifies the start position of the string. In Regex the code for this is: [``/^(h`]
- The $ represents the end of the string in question. In Regex the code for this is: [`/?$/``]

### Quantifiers
- The ? Symbol Matches the previous token between 0 and 1 times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed.
- The (*) Symbol Matches the prevoius token between 0 and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed.
- The (+) Symbol Matches the previous token between 1 and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed.
- {2,6}	Matches the previous token between 2 and 6 times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed.
### Character Classes
- \w	Matches any word character. Alphanumeric charatcer plus underscore. [\/\w \.-]
- \d	Matches a single character that is a digit. ([\da-z\.-]+)
### Flags
-N/A With This Expression
### Grouping and Capturing
- (?:...)	Matches everything enclosed. Ex: 	(https?:\/\/)?
### Bracket Expressions
- [a-z]	Matches a single character in the range between a and z: 
- [ \/ \w \.-]	Matching a single character present in the list to the right:
